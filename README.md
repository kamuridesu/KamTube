# KamTube
Download video and audio from Youtube

## Usage
`npm i kamtube`

`import KamTube from 'kamtube'`

Examples in docs/examples.md

## Purpose
This package uses ytb.trom.tf and Invidious instances to load the videos, retrieve metadata and download. Those youtube alternate frontends aren't blocked on places that youtube may be and are trade-free, making them a good alternative.

The downside is that they are much slower than default youtube and modules, so my recommendation is to only use this as last alternative.
